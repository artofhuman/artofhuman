Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Semyon, and I'm a backend engineer, focusing on Python and Ruby, but not limited to them.<br />
Time to time, I contribute to [various open-source projects](https://github.com/pulls?page=1&q=is%3Apr+author%3Aartofhuman+archived%3Afalse+is%3Apublic), usualy which I use every day.

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/artofhuman) or [LinkediIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/semyonpupkov/)
